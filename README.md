## AudioFlow - Synchronized Audio Listening Rooms
[AudioFlow](http://audioflow.onrender.com "AudioFlow") is a real-time web application that allows users to create listening rooms, upload audio files, and listen together in perfect synchronization, no matter where they are. It's designed to bring back the shared experience of listening to music with friends, remotely.
